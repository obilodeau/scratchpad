To run:

    ansible-playbook <file.yml>

To run an arbitrary command on a set of dynamic hosts:

    ansible -i ./digital_ocean.py mytag -a uptime

This will run the `uptime` command (default module is command and -a is
argument to module) on all digital ocean hosts (of a given API token) with the
tag mytag.

`digital_ocean.py` is a copy of the script located in the `contrib/inventory/`
directory of the ansible main repository.
