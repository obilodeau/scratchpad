== Logging

Setting

    context.log_level = 'debug'

Will output all sent and received interactions in a safe way. Quite useful.

== Interact with local processes

With process

    p = process('./pewpewboat.exe')

If program you interact with is not line-buffered (uses ncurses or a TTY
device directly) then open with `stdin=PTY` as follows:

    p = process('./pewpewboat.exe', stdin=PTY)

Otherwise it's mostly:

    p.sendline(stuff)
    p.recv() # or p.recv(timeout=2)
