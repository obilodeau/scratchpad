= IPv6

Some notes on IPv6

== Addressing

=== Link-local

`FE80::/10` is reserved for link-local addresses. They are based on the MAC
address. THC's tool `address6` can do the conversion. It's very similar to the
MAC but not quite

=== Loopback

`::1` (or `0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001`) is reserved for loopback

=== Unique-Local Address

This is like private addresses in IPv4.

`fc00::/7` is the reserved block but the first half `fc00::/8` has not been
defined yet.

`fd00::/8` is like `192.168.0.0/16` and is defined for `/48` prefixes. The RFC
suggests using a random 40 bit prefix for your organization, 16 bits for
subnets (65536 of them) and a `/64` will remain for addressing per subnet.

    fd00::/8
    \- reserved unique-local address range
    fde4:8dba:82e1::/48
      \----------- random 40bit prefix
    fde4:8dba:82e1:xxxx:/64
                   \--- the 16 bits for the subnet


== Addressing compatibility quirks

=== Windows UNC Paths

Althought an IPv4 address works in a UNC path like `\\192.168.1.24\C$`, for
IPv6 it doesn't work. However, Microsoft introduced a hack. There is a special
domain called `.ipv6.literal.net` that will translate an IPv6 written in a
dash separated form into a valid IPv6 address after DNS resolution.

    FE80-AB00--200D-617B.ipv6.literal.net

Returns

    fe80:ab00::200d:617b


== OSINT

On shodan, one can use the `has_ipv6:1` search modifier on any given query.


== Attacks

THC IPv6 tools

alive6:: Shows alive addresses in a given segment, useful for quickly identifying potential targets in range.
dnsrevenum6:: Performs reverse DNS lookups for IPv6 addresses, useful for if you've got an IP and you want to find the domain associated with it.
exploit6:: Performs various CVE exploits, however, BE CAREFUL some of the exploits are unstable and could crash the host...
firewall6:: Runs a lot of access control list(ACL) bypass attempts to check different implementations of firewalling & restrictions.
passive_discovery6:: Passively sniffs the network and dump all clientâ€™s IPv6 addresses, very useful for internal infrastructure assessments for identifying potential IPv6 targets.
trace6:: An implementation of traceroute for IPv6 which runs a bit quicker than traceroute6.
