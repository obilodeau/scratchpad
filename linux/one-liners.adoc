= Useful one-liners

== Mirror/archive a website

    wget --mirror --page-requisites --adjust-extension -e robots=off --base=./ --convert-links <URL>

== File copy with progress

rsync can be used but by its design it uses two CPUs so avoid it on single CPU
systems.

Progress seems nice although I never tried it:

pv is used in a pipe to do monitor what is going through it. It can be wrapped
in a bigger construct:

    tar c sourceDirectory | pv | tar x -C destinationDirectory

or even as a fct:

    cpstat () {
        tar c "$1" | pv | tar x -C "$2"
    }
